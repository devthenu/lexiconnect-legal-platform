# LexiConnect – Team Instructions (Short)

## 1. Git Workflow

- Main branches:
  - `main` → final, stable code
  - `dev` → integration branch (everyone merges here)
- Personal feature branches (one per member):
  - `feature-thenu-booking`
  - `feature-chapa-search`
  - `feature-meths-documents`
  Test note: Sample commit by Methsarani (feature-meths-documents).

  - `feature-vithana-scheduling`
  - `feature-udavi-kyc`

### How each member works

1. Clone the repo (once):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/S-W-Development-Group-Project-UOG-4-7/LexiConnect.git
   cd LexiConnect

Switch to dev branch and pull latest work:

git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
fgvdxvfb

Create your own feature branch (each person does this only once):

# Thenu:
git checkout -b feature-thenu-booking

# Chapa:
git checkout -b feature-chapa-search

# Methsarani:
git checkout -b feature-meths-documents

# Vithana:
git checkout -b feature-vithana-scheduling

# Udavi:
git checkout -b feature-udavi-kyc


Work ONLY in your feature branch. When you finish a small part and want to save:

git status
git add .
git commit -m "short description of what you did"
git push origin your-branch-name


Then go to GitHub → open the repository → click Pull requests → New pull request.

Base branch: dev

Compare branch: your feature branch (for example, feature-chapa-search)

Create the PR.
The leader (Thenu) will review and merge into dev.

2. How to run the backend (FastAPI)

Open a terminal and go to the backend folder:

cd backend


Activate the Python virtual environment:

.\venv\Scripts\Activate


If this works, your terminal prompt will start with (venv).

Run the FastAPI server:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload


Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
You should see: {"status": "ok"}

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
You should see the FastAPI Swagger UI with all API endpoints.

To stop the server, go back to the terminal and press:

Ctrl + C

3. How to run the frontend (React)

Open another terminal (new window or new tab).

Go to the frontend folder:

cd "D:/Studies/LNBTI/Semester 5/SD-Project/LexiConnect/frontend"


Install dependencies (only the first time):

npm install


Run the development server:

npm run dev


Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:5173/

You should see the LexiConnect React page with navigation links.

To stop the frontend dev server, press:

Ctrl + C
